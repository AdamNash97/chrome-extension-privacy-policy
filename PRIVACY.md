## Privacy Policy for Chrome Extensions

Last updated: October 30, 2024

# Introduction
Thank you for using my Chrome extensions. I respect your privacy and am committed to ensuring that your data remains secure. This privacy policy explains my approach to data collection, usage, and sharing across all of my Chrome extensions.

# Data Collection
My Chrome extensions do not collect any personal data. I do not track, store, or process any information that could identify you or your browsing activities.

# Data Usage and Sharing
Since no data is collected, my extensions do not use or share any information with third parties. All functionality is contained within the extension and operates solely on your device, with no external data transmission.

# Third-Party Services and External Links
My extensions do not use any third-party services, APIs, or links to external websites. Each extension is fully self-contained, using only the code provided within the extension itself.

# Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update this privacy policy occasionally to reflect changes in my practices or legal requirements. Any updates will be made to this document. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
